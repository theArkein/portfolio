# Introduction to GraphQL: A Modern Query Language for APIs

GraphQL is a powerful and flexible query language designed for APIs. Developed by Facebook, GraphQL provides a more efficient, flexible, and intuitive alternative to traditional REST APIs. In this introductory guide, we'll explore the fundamentals of GraphQL and why it has gained popularity among developers.

## What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries with your existing data. It allows clients to request only the data they need, eliminating over-fetching and under-fetching of data common in traditional REST APIs.

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Schema**

In GraphQL, the schema defines the structure of the data that clients can request. It includes types for objects, queries, and mutations. Types are the building blocks that represent the data structure.

```graphql
type Query {
  getUser(id: ID!): User
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
}
```
