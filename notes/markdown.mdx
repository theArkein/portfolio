#### Markdown: A Quick Introduction

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format. It's widely used for formatting text on the web, and its simplicity makes it a favorite among developers, bloggers, and writers.

```markdown
# This is a Level 1 Header

## This is a Level 2 Header

### This is a Level 3 Header
```
