# Discovering JavaScript ES6 Features: A Modern JavaScript Revolution

ECMAScript 2015, commonly known as ES6, introduced a plethora of new features and improvements to the JavaScript language. These enhancements have significantly improved the readability, maintainability, and overall developer experience. In this guide, we'll explore some key features of ES6 that have become essential tools for modern JavaScript developers.

## 1. **let and const Declarations**

ES6 introduced two new variable declaration keywords: `let` and `const`. These provide block-scoping, allowing developers to declare variables with more control over their scope.

```javascript
// Using let
let count = 0;
count = 1;

// Using const
const pi = 3.14;
```
